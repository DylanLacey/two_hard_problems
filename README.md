# Two Hard Problems 
## What is it?
It's said there are two hard problems in computer science:
 1. Caching
 2. Naming Things
 3. Off by one errors

This project claims to help with naming things by letting users vote for names of projects.

## What is it, really?
OK, so really, this is an example that integrates Storybook with [Screener](https://screener.io), showing how they work together to provide visual tesing.  Combined, they accelerate your development process and ensure your users have the best experience.

The app is implemented as React components, demoed with Storybook.
